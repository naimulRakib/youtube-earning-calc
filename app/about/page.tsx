      <h3>Empowering Bangladeshi Creators</h3>
      <p>BD Creator Calc is the first hyper-localized YouTube earnings estimator specifically designed for the Bangladeshi digital economy. Our mission is to provide transparency to content creators about their earning potential.</p>
      
      <h3>Why We Are Different</h3>
      <p>Unlike global tools like SocialBlade, we focus on the specific CPM rates of the Bangladesh market. We integrate local fiscal laws, including the 2025-26 Tax slabs and the 2.5% government remittance incentive, to give you the most accurate "Net Take Home" calculation.</p>

      <h3>Our Technology</h3>
      <p>Built using Next.js 14, our platform is optimized for speed and reliability, ensuring that creators can access financial data instantly without heavy page loads.</p>
